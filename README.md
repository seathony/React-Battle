# React-Battle

### Quick Start

#### 1. Get the latest version

You can start by cloning the latest version on your
local machine by running:

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/seathony/React-Battle.git
$ cd React-Battle
```

#### 2. Run `npm install`

This will install both run-time project dependencies and developer tools listed
in [package.json](../package.json) file.

#### 3. Run `npm start`

This command will build the app from the source files (`/src`) into the output
`/build` folder. As soon as the initial build completes, it will start the
Node.js server (`node build/server.js`) with 
[HMR](https://webpack.github.io/docs/hot-module-replacement) on top of it.

> [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) â€” Node.js server <br>

Now you can open your web app in a browser, on mobile devices and start
hacking. Whenever you modify any of the source files inside the `/app` folder,
the module bundler ([Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/)) will recompile the
app on the fly and refresh all the connected browsers.

#### 4 Play

Play by entering Github Usernames into browser.
